## Game Synopsis <br />

You play as Starry, a Ceiling Star in a kid's bedroom who fell. Having 
lost their family when they fell, Starry now searches for a way to get get
back among the stars. To do so, Starry must traverse the bedroom and other 
play sights, like the story book and sand box, to find rocket pieces that
will combine to build a rocket that will send Starry home.<br />

The goal of the game is to locate and collect 3 Rocket Parts distributed
amongst the three levels. The parts are held or guarded by strong enemies
which Starry must avoid or defeat to collect their parts. Combat is carried
out in a turn based style and relies on timing and the usage of special
combat items to deal maximum damage. By defeating enemies, Starry collects 
Galaxy Coins that can be used in the Bear Shop to buy these combat items.
Do you have what it takes to send Starry Home?.<br />
